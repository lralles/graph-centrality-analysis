# User Guide

Welcome to the Graph Centrality Analysis application user guide.

## Quick Start

The Graph Centrality Analysis tool helps you understand how removing nodes affects centrality measures in networks. You can analyze your own graph data or explore with built-in random graphs.

## Quick Workflow

1. **Load Graph**: Select a file (TSV, CYS, GEXF) or use a random graph
2. **Configure**: Set column mappings for TSV files or select network from CYS
3. **Preview**: View graph structure and adjacency list
4. **Select**: Choose nodes to remove and centrality measure
5. **Analyze**: Run the analysis to see impact on remaining nodes
